Users will be able to login when they enter the correct password only(SmartServTest@123) and it checks following conditions to consider email and password

a.Email will be considered only when the correct email format text is typed.

1) Email and password validation should be done by javascript

2) Entering the password as "SmartServTest@123" will redirect the user to a dashboard page else it alert the users by saying Incorrect password!!.
